This example demonstrates an unexpected behavior in F# when trying to modify a mutable list in-place within a recursive function.  The code attempts to increment each element of a mutable list, but directly assigning the result of the recursive function to the list results in a compiler error. The solution shows a correct approach using a helper function and avoiding direct in-place modification of the list.
